Reflection

What I Learned
----------------
Working on this Budget Tracker helped me understand how different programming concepts connect in a real project. I learned how to apply Object-Oriented Programming by creating a Transaction class and extending it through Income and Expense using inheritance. This made me appreciate how subclasses reduce duplication and keep the structure clean. I also deepened my understanding of modularity by separating the program into functions like add_income(), add_expense(), filter_transactions(), and show_summary().

Using lists to store transactions gave me practical experience with collections and iteration. This became especially important when listing, summarizing, and filtering data. I also strengthened my skills in input validation, ensuring the program continues running even when the user enters incorrect values.

Challenges I Faced
-------------------
One of the main challenges I faced was structuring the methods inside the BudgetTracker class correctly so the indentation aligned with Python’s class rules. At first, some functions were outside the class unintentionally, which caused errors. I also struggled with designing the filtering feature because it involved multiple conditions (type, category, and month) and required careful comparison of user input with stored transaction data.

Another difficulty was validating numeric input for amounts. I had to keep the program from crashing when a user typed letters or symbols instead of numbers, which meant using try-except blocks effectively. Finally, organizing the logic for totals and per-category summaries required careful looping and accumulation without mixing income and expense values.

How I Intend to Improve It
---------------------------
Given more time, I would upgrade the program in several ways. First, I would add proper date validation to ensure all dates follow the YYYY-MM-DD format. I also want to build an “undo last transaction” feature to correct mistakes easily.

Another improvement would be introducing budget alerts to warn the user when expenses pass a certain threshold. I would also enhance the user experience by improving the formatting of outputs—for example, separating income and expenses visually or adding simple color cues. Finally, I plan to add automated tests to verify that calculations like totals and balances remain accurate. These improvements would make the program more user-friendly, more reliable, and closer to a full budgeting tool.
